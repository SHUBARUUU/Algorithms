**Algorithms**

_A step-by-step set of instructions_ -- To solve a problem or complete a task

Analogy:

The algorithm is like the recipe—the detailed steps the chef follows to turn ingredients into the final dish. Even with a plan (paradigm) and the chef’s techniques (Algo-Techniques), the algorithm is the exact sequence of actions that produces the result.

Key Points:

Algorithms are precise and unambiguous.

They can be implemented in code using different programming languages.

Efficiency matters, some algorithms reach the answer faster or use fewer resources.

Algorithms can contain widely known paradigms (backbone) or algorithmic techniques.


Examples of Common Algorithms:


Sorting Algorithms: Organize data in order (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort).

Searching Algorithms: Find items in a dataset (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search).

Graph Algorithms: Solve problems on graphs (e.g., Dijkstra’s shortest path, BFS, DFS).

Dynamic Programming Algorithms: Solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler overlapping subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem).

Greedy Algorithms: Make the best local choice at each step to find a global solution (e.g., Minimum Spanning Tree, Activity Selection).
