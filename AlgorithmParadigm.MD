**Paradigms**

_A backbone of an algorithm_ -- A way to strategize and organize how to solve a problem with code.

Analogy:

Think of paradigms as the plan you make before cooking. Before following a recipe step by step, you decide whether you’ll cook in a certain style, use ingredients together, or focus on the final dish. In programming, paradigms are that plan or strategy, and the algorithm is the exact steps you follow based on that plan.

Examples of Common Algorithmic Paradigms:

Divide and Conquer: Break the problem into smaller parts, solve each, then combine the results.

Backtracking: Try possibilities one by one, and backtrack if a path doesn’t work.

Greedy: Make the best choice at each step, hoping it leads to the best overall solution.

Dynamic Programming: Solve problems by solving smaller overlapping subproblems and reusing results.

Recursion: Solve a problem by having the function call itself on smaller versions of the problem.

Brute Force: Try all possible solutions until you find the correct one.
