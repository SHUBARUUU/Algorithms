**Algorithmic Techniques**

_Practical methods or tricks programmers use to solve problems efficiently._ -- They act as building blocks of paradigms, it can be reused across many problems.

Analogy:

Techniques are like the chef’s cooking style or tricks. Even with a plan (paradigm) and a recipe (algorithm), knowing how to chop, stir, time ingredients, or arrange them efficiently makes the cooking faster and smoother. In coding, techniques like two pointers or sliding windows are these “smart moves” that help programmers solve problems efficiently.

Examples of Common Algorithmic Techniques:

Two Pointers: Scan data from both ends or two directions at once.

Sliding Window: Move a fixed-size “window” over data to check parts efficiently.

Fast and Slow Pointers: Detect cycles or find the middle in lists or arrays.

Prefix Sum: Precompute totals so you can answer range questions quickly.

Binary Search: Quickly find items in sorted data by cutting the search area in half each time.

Stack / Queue Tricks: Process items in a smart order using these structures.

Recursion / DFS / BFS: Explore trees, graphs, or structures step by step systematically.
